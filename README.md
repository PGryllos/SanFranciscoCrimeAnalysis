## Crime Incident Analysis on Data from SFPD


This repository hosts a report from my analysis on the crime incident data provided freely by the SFPD through the [portal](https://data.sfgov.org/), as part of my sumbission for the _Crime Analytics_ assignment for the course __Communicating Data Science Results__ by University of Washington, Coursera.

You can view the report [here][report]. If you have jupyter notebook installed you can also clone the repository and run
an interactive version of the report using the `report.ipynb` file. All the scripts are also included separately inside the folder scripts.
